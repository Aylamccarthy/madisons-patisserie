## BUGS
### Solved
* ** Duplicate key error. 
     When I added the unique attribute on sku and code fields (to ensure that all the products skus and codes are unique and therefore will prevent error of duplication for future data entries), I got the duplicate key error. I found this bug significantly challenging as I have never encountered it from previous problem. And also because this is my first experience implementing fixtures file on a project, this bug had been so challenging but at the same time a great learning experience.
     Solution:
     After research and tutor and mentor consultation, I reset my database. Make migrations again. Create a new superuser. And reload data again.
