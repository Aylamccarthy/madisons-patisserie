## Overview
Madison's Patisserie is an e-commerce website created for a fictive bakeshop located in Cork, Ireland. The main purpose of the project was to implement a fully functional online store that will make the process of selecting and purchasing baked products much easier for customers.<br>
The users are given the possibility to see every product's details, create a wishlist, add items to the shopping bag, purchase with an online payment and access orders' history. Also, the staff members have permission for controlling the data using specially designed features.<br>
The website was developed using Python(Django), HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database using ElephantSql for manipulation.
